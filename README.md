# Find the Treasure

## Description

Find the Treasure is an engaging game where players unlock multiple levels by successfully finding a hidden treasure on a map. Each round, the treasure is randomly placed behind one of several “X” marks on the map. Players start at Level 1 and, with each correct guess, gain access to the next level. You have three tries per level: guess on the first try for 3 stars, the second for 2 stars, and the third for 1 star.
